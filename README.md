# Open Source Day

This is a Hackathon style event where we meet and contribute to opensource projects.

Since this is orgranized by [Reactjs Bangalore](https://twitter.com/ReactBangalore), most of our attendees will be Javascript and React developers. So picking JavaScript libraries that are related to React, React Native and GraphQL will make it easy for us to collaborate and contribute.

Checkout [issues](https://github.com/ReactBangalore/open-source-day/issues) to find the good list of beginner friendly issues you can start contributing to. Feel free to add new issues to this repo when you come across issues that are interesting for other attendees to contibute.

# Communication

We will use [open-source-day](https://reactbangalore.slack.com/messages/CJ9ULM0RJ) slack channel of ReactBangalore group to discuss and collaborate. Use this [invite link](https://reactbangalore.herokuapp.com) to join, if you are not part of this slack group

Start posting about your interests and what libraries you would like to contribute in slack channel. People with similar interests can teamup and work together on Open Source day
